## How it works

The design has two channels, one for **encryption** and another for **decryption**, each controlled by a separate enable pin. The plaintext or ciphertext bitstream is XORed with a bit derived from a register variable generated by a **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)**.  

The LFSR is **programmable/customizable** to operate in **32-bit, 16-bit, 8-bit, or 4-bit modes**, depending on the select lines `sel0` and `sel1`. This provides flexibility in choosing the level of security and performance trade-off.  

During **transmission**, the plaintext (`tx_p`) is encrypted into `tx_e`. For **reception**, the encrypted stream (`rx_e`) is decrypted back into the original plaintext (`rx_p`) using the same LFSR sequence. Debug outputs (`dbg_tx_p`, `dbg_rx_e`) are available for testing but are disabled by default.  

The configuration input (`cfg_i`) and enable (`cfg_en`) allow dynamic loading of the 130-bit serial shift register, ensuring the LFSR sequence can be customized at runtime. The `cfg_o` pin provides read-back capability for verification.
