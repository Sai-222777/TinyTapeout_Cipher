## How it works

Has two channels, one for encryption and another for decryption. Each has an enable pin separately. The output is XORed with a bit of a register variable that is generated from a LFSR that can be programmed or customised to work in 32/16/8/4 bits based on the select lines 'Sel0' and 'Sel1'
